      This easy to use patient questionnaire is a self-administered version of
      the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9
      is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as
      "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). It has been validated for use
      in primary care. It is not a screening tool for depression but it is used
      to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment. However,
      it can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression in at-risk
      populations - eg, those with coronary heart disease or after stroke.
